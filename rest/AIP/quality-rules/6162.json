    "description": "Avoid Artifacts with High integration complexity (IC greater than X). Complex programs are difficult to maintain. Keeping programs small and simple ensures an good readability of the code.  PB Artifacts are Methods, Functions, Datawindows, Datastores, Events, ... The threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.",
