    "output": "This report lists all the public or protected methods that in a public type overrides a method or implements an interface, and does not have the same Link Demands as the interface or virtual methods.\n\nThis rule is relevant for any overridable methods : class/interface methods, property accessors, indexer accessors, event accessors. The .NET analyzer does not manage neither the arguments values of external security attributes (i.e. the security attributes comming with objects from external assemblies), nor the arguments values of any external attributes coming from assemblies compiled for framework 1.x., that is these values are not available to the analyzer. This implies some possible false negative when overriden objects involved in a violation pattern are external (i.e. come from external assemblies), because these argument values can not be compared. Nevertheless even in that case some violations may still be raised when the attribute type of the link demand is different between the two objects (overriding and overriden), or when there is no security attrbute at all on the overriden object (external). Another limitation is that link demands present at a type or an assembly level are not taken into account.",
