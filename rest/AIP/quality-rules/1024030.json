The defining characteristic of risks in this category of rules is that the platform (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, etc.) provides a feature or a capability that is documented and well understood.\n\nThis class was deprecated in API level 28. instead, it's recommended to use BiometricPrompt which shows a system-provided dialog upon starting authentication. \nIn a world where devices may have different types of biometric authentication, it's much more realistic to have a system-provided authentication dialog since the method may vary by vendor/device.",
