Because FieldFormula PeopleCode initiates in many different contexts and triggers PeopleCode on every field on every row in the component buffer, it can seriously degrade application performance.\nAs a matter of convention, FieldFormula is now often used in FUNCLIB_ (function library) record definitions to store shared functions.\nRespecting this best practive improves the maintainability.",
