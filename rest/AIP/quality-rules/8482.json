Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim.\n\nUsing CAST data-flow engine, this metric detects paths from API requests to HTML user output methods which are open vulnerabilities to Reflected cross-site scripting injection",
