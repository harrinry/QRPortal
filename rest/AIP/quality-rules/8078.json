    "description": "This rule searches for C++ functions that do not cast a pointer to a base class to a pointer to a derived class by using a 'static_cast' or a 'dynamic_cast'.\nThis rule is deactivated by default. If you want to activate it, please deactivate the rule #8060.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ method, constructor, and destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- pointer incorrectly casted\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - pointer cast\n  - source class\n  - target class",
    "rationale": "Casting from pointer to base class to pointer to derived class should usually be done through 'dynamic_cast'. See rule #8060 for more information.\n\nIn performances-constrained situations, and if you know through another mean that the 'dynamic_cast' will succeed, you can instead call 'static_cast', which will be slightly more efficient. In this case, it is advised to write code that will check in debug builds that the assumption is true.\n\nIn any case, a C-style cast is unsafe to use, because it will be considered as a 'reinterpret_cast' if the classes are not related, and will do the wrong thing.",
