    "description": "When enforcing the utilization of JavaDoc Comments to document an application, all Methods must have JavaDoc Comments. Those comments must be defined just before the declaration of the Method with the appropriate structure (/** */)\n\nThe Private Methods are not Considered bu this rule\nException: \n-  Methods that implement or override a method in an interface or superclass without adding any interesting behavior beyond what is already documented for the overridden method\n- Getters and Setters\n- Empty constructors",
