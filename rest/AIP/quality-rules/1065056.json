    "rationale": "Throwing an exception during start-up or termination results in the program being terminated in\nan implementation-defined manner. Before the program starts executing the body of main, it is in a start-up phase, constructing and initializing static objects. Similarly, after main has returned, it is in a termination phase where static objects are being destroyed. If an exception is thrown in either of these phases it leads to the program being terminated in an implementation-defined manner. \n\nSpecifically from Section 15.3(13) of ISO/IEC 14882:2003 [1], if main is implemented as a function-try-block, exceptions raised during start-up and close down are not caught by the catch block(s) of main.",
