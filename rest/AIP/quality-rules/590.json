    "description": "This rule searches for C++ constructors and destructors using global objects. Note that constructors and destructors using global variables defined in the same compilation are not considered as violating the rule.",
    "output": "Associated to each C++ destructor and destructor with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The global object used\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - global object used",
    "rationale": "It is not recommended to use global objects in constructors or destructors because it is not possible to know in which order the global objects are instantiated or deleted through different C++ compilation units. Thus there is a risk when global objects are used in constructors or destructors that the application will crash because a call is made to an object that is not yet in existence or has already been destroyed.",
