    "description": "Java servlets often store information associated with each client that connects to them. Using member fields in the javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet to store information specific to individual clients is a common, simple practice.\nBut all servlet fields should be static final, this approach guarantees thread-safety in the servlet.\nThis rule reports all servlet fields which are not static final \nAll Classes that extend HttpServlet at any level are considered as Servlets.",
    "output": "This report lists all non final static fields that belong to Servlet classes.\nIt provides the following information:\n  - Field full name",
    "rationale": "Servlets must be programmed in a thread-safe manner because the controller will share the same instance for multiple simultaneous requests. In addition to the servlet's threading model, if your intention is to store request-specific state and if your container provides clustering facilities, there's no guarantee that the same servlet instance will receive all the requests (from one user or all users) in a Web application.\n\nThe use of servlet fields that are not static final creates a security breach as this object is shared among multiple sessions and thus can lead to confidential data leaks.",
