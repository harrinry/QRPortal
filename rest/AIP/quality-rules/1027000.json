    "description": "Avoid Managed type declaration for Win32 API using Overlapped IO\n\nP/Invoke declaration for an API using Overlapped IO, should use pointer to an overlapped structure instead of a reference.\n\nThis rule only checks for well known and most used Win32 APIs and will not cover native third-party or user assemblies.\n\nList of API functions checked for incorrect P/Invoke declarations - ConnectNamedPipe, LockFileEx, ReadFile, ReadFileEx, ReadFileScatter, UnlockFileEx, WriteFile, WriteFileEx, WriteFileGather, GetQueuedCompletionStatus, PostQueuedCompletionStatus, DeviceIoControl, GetOverlappedResult, CancelIoEx, GetOverlappedResultEx, TransactNamedPipe, WaitCommEvent, ReadDirectoryChangesW, ReadDirectoryChangesExW",
    "output": "Number of Methods using Overlapped IO via references (instead of pointers) and not marked UNSAFE.",
    "rationale": "Overlapped IO is used for asynchronous Win32 API.\n\nThe caller of such API initializes and passes a Overlapped structure and completion or failure of the API call is conveyed through the structure.\n\nThis means that the memory allocated for Overlapped structure should stay allocated until said IO operation is completed.\n\nWith P/Invoke, if Overlapped IO structure is allocated memory using GC, there is a good chance that this memory will be collected by GC before the IO operation is completed.\n\nTo avoid such error states, it is important that P/Invoke declarations for API using overlapped IO be made using unsafe pointer to a Overlapped structure.\nThis declaration conveys to the user of P/Invoke that allocations for this function should be made in an unsafe context.",
