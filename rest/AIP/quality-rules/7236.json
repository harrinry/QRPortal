    "output": "Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in source code:\n  - PERFORM statement that refers to the paragraph it belongs to",
    "rationale": "The PERFORM statement allows calling paragraphs with several call levels. However, Cobol is not a recursive language and can not manage paragraph recursive calls correctly. When a paragraph is called via a PERFORM statement, then the calling statement is saved into a stack and the control flow jumps to the beginning of the called paragraph. At the end of this paragraph, then the control flow returns to the calling statement. A recursive call can alter the calling statement stack and the control flow may be unpredictable. \nFurthermore, all data are global to the program. Then, if a paragraph called at level 'n' modifies a data, then this data is modified for all the call levels. \nFor all these reasons, it is better to replace paragraph recursive calls by loops.",
