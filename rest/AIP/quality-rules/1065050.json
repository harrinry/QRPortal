    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "A possible programming error in C++ is to apply the sizeof operator to expression and expect the expression to be evaluated. However, the expression is not evaluated as sizeof only acts on the type of the expression. To avoid this error, sizeof shall not be used on expressions that would contain side effects if they were used elsewhere, as the side effects will not occur.",
