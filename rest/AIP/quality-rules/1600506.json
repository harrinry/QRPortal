    "output": "This report lists all the PeopleSoft SQL Definitions having a SELECT * statement.\nIt provides the following information: \n- PeopleSoft SQL Definition full name.",
    "rationale": "The consequences are two fold:\nA query that retrieves all columns of a table with a SELECT * can potentially be the source of important changeability problems. One cannot control how the columns will be ordered and returned to the client. This can lead to important data inconsistencies and thus stability issues.\n\nAlso performance problems may arise when the execution of the query returns a large result sets (many rows with all the columns may then become a huge amount of data to transport over the network). Thus optimizer module can't provide a correct execution.",
