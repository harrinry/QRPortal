    "rationale": "Applications, having threads that try to acquire a lock, on an object that has a weak identity, can have reliability issues. This is because the thread can be blocked by a second thread in a different application domain that has a lock on the same object. An object is said to have a weak identity when it can be directly accessed across application domain boundaries. The following types have a weak identity and are flagged by the rule:\n* MarshalByRefObject \n* ExecutionEngineException \n* OutOfMemoryException \n* StackOverflowException \n* String \n* MemberInfo \n* ParameterInfo \n* Thread",
