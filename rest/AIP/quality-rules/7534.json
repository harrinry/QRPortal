    "description": "This metric retrieves all ABAP Artifacts using READ statements on standard ABAP internal tables without using the BINARY SEARCH option.\nREAD statement on SORTED and HASHED tables are not taken into account as they do not require the  BINARY SEARCH option.",

    "rationale": "When a the READ command is used without the BINARY SEARCH option, the internal table  is sequentially searched (equivalent of an SQL table scan). The consequence  is poor performance especially when the size of internal table is large or if it grows. Instead of this, it is recommended to use the BINARY SEARCH option. The binary search  algorithm is much faster to search of a value in an internal table. It is however necessary to sort the internal table before doing a binary search in order to get that performance advantage.",
