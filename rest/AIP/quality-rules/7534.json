    "output": "Associated to each ABAP Artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides:\n- The number of violation patterns",
    "rationale": "When a the READ command is used without the BINARY SEARCH option, the internal table  is sequentially searched (equivalent of an SQL table scan). The consequence  is poor performance especially when the size of internal table is large or if it grows. Instead of this, it is recommended to use the BINARY SEARCH option. The binary search  algorithm is much faster to search of a value in an internal table. It is however necessary to sort the internal table before doing a binary search in order to get that performance advantage.",
