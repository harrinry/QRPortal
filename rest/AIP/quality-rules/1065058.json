    "description": "This QR would raise violations for almost ALL main\\WinMain functions.\nThe functions considered are main, WinMain, InitInstance, ExitInstance.\nThis will give violations if there are any statements out of try\\catch statement or if try in the main does not have catch all. Multiple try\\catch are allowed but each try should have catch-all and none of the statements should be outside try\\catch. The only exception is if main has only one statement \u201creturn <number>;\u201d or main is empty.",

    "rationale": "If a program throws an unhandled exception it terminates in an implementation-defined manner. In particular, it is implementation-defined whether the call stack is unwound, before termination, so the destructors of any automatic objects may or may not be executed. By enforcing the provision of a \u201clast-ditch catch-all\u201d, the developer can ensure that the program terminates in a consistent manner. This rule\u2019s objective is to ensure that exceptions that were not expected are also caught.",
