It's recommended to apply the ServiceContract attribute to an interface, although it can be applied to a class as well. Operation Contract is applied to a method to indicate that the method implements a service operation as part of a service contract.\nThus to have a service contract without any meaningful operation contract(method) to do a task indicates missing logic.",
