These classes are , in turn, derived from common superclass CX_ROOT.  \n\nAs ABAP BEST PRACTICE: CX_ROOT, as base exception type, it should not be used in the CATCH clause of a TRY\u2026CATCH\u2026ENDTRY statement. In the CATCH clause of a TRY\u2026CATCH\u2026ENDTRY statement the exception class defines the exception that should be handled. \n\nCatching directly CX_ROOT may hide dangerous system errors that your CATCH logic was intended to deal with.",
