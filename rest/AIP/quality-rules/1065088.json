    "description": "This rule will raise a violation when member function returns non-const handles to class data",
    "rationale": "By implementing class interfaces with member functions the implementation retains more control over how the object state can be modified and helps to allow a class to be maintained without affecting clients. Returning a handle to class-data allows for clients to modify the state of the object without using any interfaces.",
    "reference": "MISRA C++ 2008, 9-3-2: Member functions shall not return non-const handles to class-data.\n\nAUTOSAR C++ 2014, A9-3-1: Member functions shall not return non-const \u201craw\u201d pointers or references to private or protected data owned by the class.",
    "remediation": "A resource can be used by the class but is not class-data, non-const handles to this data may be returned.",
    "remediationSample": "class C\n{\npublic:\nC ( int32_t * shared ) : m_shared ( shared )\n{\n}\nint32_t * getA ()\n{\nreturn m_shared; // Compliant - m_shared is not class-data\n}\nprivate:\nint32_t * m_shared;\n};",
