    "rationale": "Struts is a Framework for building Model-View-Controller 2 Web applications. This model is the Blueprints recommended architectural design pattern for interactive applications. The logical separation between presentation layer, the business logic layer, and the data access layer is basically an architectural way to minimize the amount of additional work necessary to add features to any layer that can be consumed by another layer.\nIt separates design concerns (data persistence and behavior, presentation, and control), decreasing code duplication, centralizing control, and making the application more easily modifiable. MVC 2 also helps developers with different skill sets to focus on their core skills and collaborate through clearly defined interfaces.",
