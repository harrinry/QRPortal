    "description": "Avoid using late binding.\n\nLate binding is done when a call to CreateObject is done AND that the variables are of type Object/Variant.\nWhenever  a variable is typed during the definition (dim var as MyObject) it becomes early binding.",
    "output": "This report lists all uses of late binding",
    "rationale": "Even if late binding offer advantages (like being version independent), it suffers from several disadvantages compared to early binding. \nWith early binding:\n- Code is much faster\n- Compiler can detect error at compilation time rather than execution time\n- Intellisense is available",
    "remediation": "Use early binding.",
