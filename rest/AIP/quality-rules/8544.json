Depending on the nature of the application, the task of reviewing log files may be performed manually or sometimes automated with a tool that automatically gathers log data for important events or trending information. \nInterpretation of the log files may be hindered or misdirected if an attacker can supply data to the application that is subsequently logged verbatim.\n\nAnyway, this should not be a problem as per debug level should not appear in production.",
