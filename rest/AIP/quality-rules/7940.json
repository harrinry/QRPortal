    "description": "The @Remove annotation is used with a method to inform the container that the client no longer needs a session and that the session should be destroyed. This annotation is important, as it is the only way to request the container that the session should end. If the remove method is not used, every stateful bean instance ever created would always have to be timed out to be passivated (if the container implementation supports passivation) and timed out again to be finally destroyed.\n\n\n\nThis rule reports a violation for :\n- Class that defines an instance variable or local variable whose type is a local or remote business interface of a Stateful Session but doesn't invoke the remove method in any of its methods. \n- Class when the Stateful Session Bean doesn't implement the remove method.\n\nNotes\n1- The remove method is defined by the @Remove annotation or remove-method deployment descriptor element on the Stateful Session Bean.\n2- In the case of several EJB instances, there is no guarantee that all EJB instances will be removed. \nWe only check there is at least one call to remove method for the concerned class",

    "rationale": "Since stateful session beans cannot be pooled and reused like stateless beans, there is a real danger of accumulating too many of them if we don\u2019t have a way to destroy them. Therefore, we have to define a business method for removing the bean instance by the client using the @Remove annotation.\nif not done, and especially in a highly concurrent system, this could have a drastic performance impact. There would be wasted CPU cycles and disk space used in the unnecessary activation/passivation process. This is why it is critical that you remove stateful bean instances when the client is finished with its work instead of relying on the container to destroy them when they time out.",
