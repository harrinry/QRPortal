    "description": "A domain model represents the business entities used in a Java application. In a layered system architecture, the domain model is used to execute business logic in the business layer. The domain model implementation is such an important piece of code that it shouldn\u2019t depend on other Java APIs\n\nThis rule checks if there is any direct calls or indirect(via successive) calls from persistent classes' artifact to the methods of the following packages:\n\n- java.sql.*\n- javax.sql.*\n- javax.naming.* (include javax.naming.directory, javax.naming.event, javax.naming.ldap, javax.naming.spi)\n- javax.jms.*\n\n\nNote that we don't take into account method parameters and exception that belongs to these packages.\n\nThis list of pakages/APIs to exclude can be extended using via the rule's paramter.",

    "rationale": "The domain model implementation is usually a central, organizing component; it's reused heavily whenever you implement new application functionality. For this reason, you should be prepared to go to some lengths to ensure that concerns other than business aspects don't leak into the domain model implementation. The domain model should be concerned only with modeling the business domain. When these concerns start to appear in the domain model classes, we call this an example of leakage of concerns.\nFor example, code in the domain model shouldn't perform JNDI lookups or call the database via the JDBC API. This allows you to reuse the domain model implementation virtually anywhere. Most importantly, it makes it easy to unit test the domain model (in JUnit, for example) outside of any application server or other managed environment.",
