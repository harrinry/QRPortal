If you need a copy constructor, it's because you need something like a deep copy, or some other management of resources. Thus it is almost certain that you will need a destructor and assignment operator. \n\nIf you don't need a copy constructor (because the default-generated copy constructor would be correct), you should let the compiler generate it: it will not contain bugs, and you will often not have to update it when the class is modified.",
