    "description": "Without reauthenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced; thereby facilitating malicious activity.\n\nIn addition to the reauthentication requirements associated with session locks, organizations may require reauthentication of devices, including (but not limited to), the following other situations:\n\n(i) When authenticators change;\n(ii) When roles change;\n(iii) When security categories of information systems change;\n(iv) After a fixed period of time;\nor\n(v) Periodically.\n\nFor distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of identification claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide the identification decisions (as opposed to the actual identifiers) to the services that need to act on those decisions.\n\nGateways and SOA applications are examples of where this requirement would apply.",
