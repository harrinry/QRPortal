    "description": "To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, non-privileged users must utilize multifactor authentication to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.\n\nMultifactor authentication uses two or more factors to achieve authentication.\n\nFactors include:\n\n(i) Something you know (e.g., password/PIN);\n(ii) Something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, CAC/SIPRNet token); or\n(iii) Something you are (e.g., biometric).\n\nA non-privileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a non-privileged user.\n\nNetwork access is any access to an application by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) where said access is obtained through a network connection.\n\nApplications integrating with the DoD Active Directory and utilize the DoD CAC are an example of compliant multifactor authentication solutions.",
