    "description": "Without identifying devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.\n\nWith one way SSL authentication which is the typical form of SSL authentication done between a web browser client and a web server, the client requests the server certificate to validate the server's identity and establish a secure connection.\n\nWhen SSL mutual authentication is used, the server is configured to request the client\u2019s certificate as well so the server can also identify the client.\n\nFor distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of identification claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide the identification decisions (as opposed to the actual identifiers) to the services that need to act on those decisions.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that connect either locally, remotely, or through a network to an endpoint device (including but not limited to: workstations, printers, servers (outside a datacenter), VoIP Phones, VTC CODECs). Gateways and SOA applications are examples of where this requirement would apply.",
