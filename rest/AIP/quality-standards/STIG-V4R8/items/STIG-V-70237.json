    "description": "DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nXML-based applications are susceptible to DoS attacks due to the nature of XML parsing being processor intensive and complicated.\n\nBest practice for parsing XML to avoid DoS include:\n\n- Using a proven XML parser\n- Using an XML gateway that provides DoS protection\n- Using parser options that provide limits on recursive payloads, oversized payloads, and entity expansion.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of applications to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on application availability. For each application, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the application opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.",
