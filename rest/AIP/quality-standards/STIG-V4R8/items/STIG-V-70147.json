    "description": "The application must ensure that a user does not retain any rights that may have been granted or retain access to the application after the user's authorization or role within the application has been deleted or modified.  This means once a user's role/account within the application has been modified, deleted or disabled, the changes must be enforced immediately within the application.  Any privileges or access the user had prior to the change must not be retained.  For example; any application sessions that the user may have already established prior to the configuration change must be terminated when the user account changes occur.\n\nSimply removing a user from a web application without terminating any existing application user sessions can introduce a scenario where the deleted user still has access to the application even though their account has been deleted from the authentication store. This can be attributed to browser caching and session management on the web server.\n\nTo address this, the web application must provide a means for ensuring this type of \"zombie\" access does not occur. Applications must provide a user management feature or function that will terminate any existing user sessions at the same time or just before the user account is terminated from the authoritative authentication source.",
