Using, calling or referencing remote resources by using hardcoded IP addresses should be avoided as they can regularly change. Instead, it is recommended using domain names or eventually store IP addresses in a configuration file. This CloudReady pattern verifies the presence of IPV4 or IPV6 addresses in the source code.",

If these dependencies are internal to your organization and reflect the current layout of your application portfolio, replace the hardcoded IPs with domain-based addressing.",
