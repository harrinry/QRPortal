        "description": "The SQL statement \u2018CREATE CREDENTIAL\u2019 is not supported in Azure SQL Database as it creates server-level database credentials. Instead, use database-scoped credentials. When used in on-premise SQL databases, the \u2018CREATE CREDENTIAL\u2019 statement creates a server-level credential. A credential is a record that contains the authentication information that is required to connect to a resource outside SQL Server. Most credentials include a Windows user and password. For example, saving a database backup to some location might require SQL Server to provide special credentials to access that location.\n\nTo make the credential at the database-level use CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL (Transact-SQL). Use a server-level credential when you need to use the same credential for multiple databases on the server. Use a database-scoped credential to make the database more portable. When a database is moved to a new server, the database scoped credential will move with it. Use database scoped credentials on SQL Database.",
