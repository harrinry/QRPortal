        "description": "This pattern verifies the presence of the \u2018assert()\u2019 function in source code. assert() is a debugging instruction that should not be found in mature code in production. Moreover, this instruction is aimed to provide information in the console, which doesn\u2019t make sense in a Cloud context.\n\nExample of assert() usage:\n\nfunction assert(condition, message) {\n    if (!condition) {\n        message = message || \"Assertion failed\";\n        if (typeof Error !== \"undefined\") {\n            throw new Error(message);\n        }\n        throw message; // Fallback\n    }\n}\nIn a COBOL context, this pattern verifies the presence of DISPLAY statements and WITH DEBUGGING MODE clauses in source code.\n\nDISPLAY statement is used to the value of a data item on a screen or write it to a file. This is used for debugging purpose. It is not good to have this in production environment.\n\nWITH DEBUGGING MODE activates a compile-time switch for debugging lines written in the source text. A debugging line is a statement that is compiled only when the compile-time switch is activated. Debugging lines allow you, for example, to check the value of a data-name at certain points in a procedure. This is used for debugging purpose. It is not good to have this in production environment.",
