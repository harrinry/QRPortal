Logging to the Event Log is not recommended for Cloud native apps. Consider refactoring to use a ConsoleTraceListener with the System.Diagnostics logging system and/or use a Cloud-based logging system.\n\nUsage of Microsoft\u2019s EventLog is detected if specific patterns are detected in the source code or in application configuration files (see pattern details below).",
