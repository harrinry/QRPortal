        "description": "Cloud/PaaS applications must be OS-agnostic as much as possible and should not rely on OS-specific features (such as system DLLs in a Windows environment), which may not be available on the Cloud environment as the underlying operating system (in this specific case, Windows) may change over time. In some cases, you can remediate this by using compatibility libraries that make one operating system \u201clook\u201d like another. However, avoid the OS-specific dependencies as much as you can, and rely instead on services that are provided by your service providers.",
