Review the dependencies in each file.\n\nFor each environment variable that needs to be set up, ensure it will exist in your container. There are two ways this information can be passed down to the container. You can use the -e option in the run command of your docker container. It is adequate when the number of variables is low. However, as soon as we have more than a handful of variables, it can quickly become cumbersome and error-prone. The second option is preferred: You can specify a file to read values from, called an env_file.",
