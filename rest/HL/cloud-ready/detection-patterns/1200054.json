        "description": "Launching additional processes within a container is not recommended. Consider refactoring this code to either embed the functionality, or establish a separate service. Apps can spawn and run arbitrary code. It is allowable for an app to do things like spawn a command shell or run a PowerShell script. However, even though arbitrary code and processes can be spawned from an app, executable programs and scripts are still restricted to the privileges granted to the parent application pool.",
