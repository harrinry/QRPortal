Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.\n\nNotifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications performing security functions and the applications performing security function verification/testing.",
