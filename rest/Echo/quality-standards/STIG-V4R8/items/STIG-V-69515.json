    "description": "Control of application execution is a mechanism used to prevent execution of unauthorized applications in order to follow the rules of least privilege. Some applications may provide a capability that runs counter to the mission or provides users with functionality that exceeds mission requirements.\n\nSome of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Removal of executable programs is not always possible; therefore, establishing a method of preventing program execution is critical to maintaining a secure system baseline.\n\nSoftware program restrictions include restricting execution of programs in certain environments, while preventing execution in other environments; or limiting execution of certain application functionality based on organization-defined criteria (e.g., privileges, subnets, sandboxed environments, security managers, roles).",
