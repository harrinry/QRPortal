In addition, attackers often manipulate logs to hide or obfuscate their activity.\n\nThe goal is to off-load application logs to a separate server as quickly and efficiently as possible so as to mitigate these risks.  \n\nA centralized logging solution offering applications an enterprise designed and managed logging capability which is the desired solution.\n\nHowever, when a centralized logging solution is not an option due to the operational environment or other situations where the risk has been officially recognized and accepted, off-loading is a common process utilized to address this type of scenario.",
