    "description": "Applications are often designed to utilize a user account.  The account represents a means to control application permissions and access to OS resources, application resources or both.  \n\nWhen the application is designed and installed, care must be taken not to assign excessive permissions to the user account that is used by the application.  \n\nAn application operating with unnecessary privileges can potentially give an attacker access to the underlying operating system or if the privileges required for application execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.\n\nApplications must be designed and configured to operate with only those permissions that are required for proper operation.",
